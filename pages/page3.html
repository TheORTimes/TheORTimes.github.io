Q:What is your current position on Origin Realms and what is your everyday job there?
<br><br>
A: Currently I am credited as a "Skin Artist", which means I make the skins for the NPCs you'll see around spawn, but I'll also make the occasional dialog portrait, or NPC specific cosmetic.

Q: What is your favorite thing regarding Origin Realms, whether it be in-game or discord?
<br><br>
A: I love the community, while it can be frustrating at times, I really wouldn't play on the server if it weren't for all the cool people I've met and hung out with, both in-game and on discord.

Q: What is your biggest achievement within Origin Realms?
<br><br>
A: As far in-game achievements go I haven't done much to be honest, so apart from that, my biggest achievement is probably making the mailbox furniture model, which is the only furniture model I've done. I'd been really wanting to create a model that was quality enough to be a furniture on Origin Realms, and I think I succeeded.
