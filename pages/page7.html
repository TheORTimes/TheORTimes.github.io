            Holckster then walks up to AsianSquid, who is visually insulted and nervous at the same time
            <br> <br>
            AsianSquid: Uh, hi boss, I needed you to approve of this volume so we can bring it to press
            <br> <br>
            Holckster: Did we get the 3 contractually obligated Mayor May ads in the issue?
            <br> <br>
            AsianSquid: Yea, we did.
            Holckster: Well then publish it and i'll let you know when the checks clear for the ads, other than that the articles are fine, I already read them while at the Rusty Bukkit Last Night.
            <br> <br>
            AsianSquid: That dive bar?
            <br> <br>
            Holckster: IT IS A PERFECTLY ADEQUATE ESTABLISHMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH, and plus I was in the middle of a lucrative business deal, I didn't choose the place. But they have killer wings Iâ€™ll have you kn- WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS JUST HAVE IT PRINTED
            <br> <br>
            AsianSquid: FINE
            <br> <br>
            Both then proceed to leave, equally offended for different reasons.
