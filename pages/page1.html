                As the festivities of the players draw to a close in this beautiful holiday season, it‚Äôs important to realize that Origin Realms isn‚Äôt just a conglomeration of events, but what we as a community make of it as well. Looking around the server, there were many ways people celebrated this season, such as Secret Santa, decorating for the holidays, making holiday exhibits, giving gifts to friends on the server, or even hosting parties. Moving forward, it will be great to see what people come up with next as more content gets added.

The OR Museum:
Have you ever wondered, ‚Äúdo I really know all of the custom content on this server?‚Äù Due to how expansive the custom resource pack is, oftentimes the answer is no. Here at the OR Museum, you can change that with ease.

The OR Museum first opened its doors to the public in 2021 with the main feature of the museum being a gigantic globe at the very entrance! The museum features event-related rooms to the left & right on the very first floor. All items & furniture of all the events to date can be found in those rooms, giving way to quite the impressive collection.  They‚Äôre very mood inspiring so I recommend checking those out. The rest of the museum displays pretty much anything that is added by Origin Realms such as custom mobs, tools, armor & blocks!
The museum was built mainly by CastielCraw as a project lead, however EpicPhil0026 and NotLyo have helped with the gathering of the materials and building the schematic!
You can visit the museum using /realm tp TheORMuseum whenever it reopens, as it is currently closed for maintenance. Be sure to check it out and see what‚Äôs in store for y‚Äôall once it reopens! üëÄ
