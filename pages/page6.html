            AsianSquid proceeds to walk past the rows of cubicles to the cafeteria, but then spots Sureaz in front of a computer. It is apparent he hasn't left his seat for days.
            <br> <br>
            Sureaz: AHHHH!!! YOU SCARED ME
            AsianSquid: DAMN don't startle me like that!! Jeez, what's happen to you? Have u been sleeping here?!
            <br> <br>
            Sureaz: ITS THE BOTS, THEY ARE NEVER SATISFIED! HOTFIX AFTER HOTFIX AND ITS NEVER ENOUGH, AND THE WEBSITE FOR THE ORTIMES DOESNT WORK ON IOS!!! DAMNNNN YOU APPLEEEEE WHY DOES WEBKIT EVEN EXIST?!?
            <br> <br>
            AsianSquid: damn, well have u seen holckster? without him this article isn't gonna release
            <br> <br>
            Sureaz: I haven't seen holckster or a source of sunlight since the christmas event, now if you excuse me I have to make the bot fool-proof, people are too stupid to use the bot correctly
            <br> <br>
            AsianSquid: Okay, hang in there
            <br> <br>
            Sureaz: Hanging sounds pretty good right about now...
            <br> <br>
            AsianSquid: I DIDN'T MEAN THA- you know what i'm leaving
            <br><br>
            AsianSquid quickly goes up 15 flights of stairs to find a penthouse office, where Holckster is on the phone in the lobby
            <br> <br>
            Holckster: Uh huh, wait no I ordered 15 Crunch Wrap Supremes, not 12, and don't forget to add the Baja Blast. Alright ty, don't make me hire another assistant, silkmoth. Now, if you excuse me there I have to talk to some BOZO in my office. 
            What was that- YES that bozo, the one with the tentecles. Alright, bye.
