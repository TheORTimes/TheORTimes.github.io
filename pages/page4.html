        Q: What is your favorite skin you have designed so far?  
        A: I love all the scout NPCs, I put a lot of effort into them, and they also show how much I've improved since I started since you can compare them to the original scouts.
        <br><br>
        Q: Do you believe that the mayor election has been rigged?
        <br><br>
        A: I'm not sure, but Mayor May seems much less corrupt than Douglass, so I wouldn't expect her to do something like that
        <br><br>
        I'll send the rest in another message because message limits :thumbsup:
        Q: What is your favorite cosmetic? Would love to know for each type; Hat, Back Gear, Prop & Balloon!
        A: For hats I really mainly use the baseball cap, it's simple, so it really fits with my skin, I think a lot of the crazier cosmetics are a bit much.
        The explorer backpack is my favorite back gear, because it really has that adventurous vibe I get from origin realms, plus I just think big backpacks are cool.
        The blunderbuss is probably my favorite prop, I don't really use props much cause I use a totem of undying/shield, but the gesture is just too much fun to use.
        The hot air ballon is my favorite balloon, because it also just really gives me Origin Realms vibes.
        <br><br>
        Q: Jacko or Robin Banks?
        A: Robin Banks for sure, Jacko is cool too, but Robin Banks is a more fun character in my opinion.
        <br><br>
        Q: What is your favorite emoji from the Origin Realms discord?
        A: :yoda_wut: is a classic, it works for so many situations too.
        <br><br>
        Q: What are your thoughts on Origin Realms, going forward?
        A: I'm pretty excited by the future, while it has been a while without any huge updates, there's a lot going on behind the scenes. I'm sure you'll learn more at the stage event, exciting stuff!
