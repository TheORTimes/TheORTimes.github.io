        AsianSquid is sitting inside his cubicle, with the final copy of The OR Times in hand. He has to show it to the Editor in Chief, Holckster, before it can go to Press
        <br> <br>
        AsianSquid: Damn, not too bad! All the articles came out great, although I'm unsure the boss will agree. Only one way to find out, now to just find him.
        <br> <br>
        AsianSquid proceeds to get out of his amazon basics chair, and ask around to find out where Holckster might be; at times, the OR times HQ can be quite hard to navigate.
        <br> <br>
        AsianSquid: Hey, Marm, have u seen where Holckster is? I need to get this to him ASAP so we can get this issue of the times to press.
        <br> <br>
        MarmaladeMellow: I haven't, last time I heard he was bullying one of the interns about wearing mismatched socks, although maybe Clif would know? He has him on speed dial as he pays for the Alpha-Vengers Tower if I remember correctly.
        <br> <br>
        AsianSquid: Can't be, Clif has been strangely absent since Mayor May got elected, strange coincidence if you ask me...
        <br> <br>
        MarmaladeMellow: What are you implying?
        <br> <br>
        AsianSquid: idk May's secret service has been going crazy since Douglas got outed. Some say the cat inherited enough money to buy not just all of OR, but buyout the press as well. Just look at this latest issue, it has 3 Mayor May articles in it, I have no doubt those were paid in full.
        <br> <br>
        MarmaladeMellow: Well, I don't mind the change, better a cat than a gambler in my eyes. Me and my 43 Cats all voted as soon as we got the chance!
        <br> <br>
        AsianSquid: Fitting. Anyway, I still need to find Holckster so you take care of yourself lol
