            As we reach the 2nd anniversary of Origin Realms, it’s good to look back upon what all has led up to now, with one example being the first ever community villager; Norbert the stonemason. Originally a zombie villager in the resource world, Norbert had a fairly normal upbringing in a not so normal place: Origin Realms, where the existence of villagers was both welcomed and shunned due to the custom systems in place. On January 23rd, 2021, after being found, he was placed in a stone house, where he was eventually cured due to the help of two individuals who brought both the apple, and the potion. Usually, this would lead to the villager simply popping out of existence in Origin Realms, yet for some reason it succeeded, leading to the unprecedented introduction of emeralds into a land who had no access to such a commodity. As greed led the players desperate to gain such an item to hastily grind for materials, one deemed Norbert’s existence to be too dangerous to continue existing; the very one who found him in the first place. Slaying Norbert with a legacy sword named “the Mea Culpa,” Norbert was lost to the constraints of death, leaving his followers in a state of mourning, causing them to build a temple in his honor. Norbert may be gone, but he is not forgotten, Rest In Peace Norbert, maybe one day villagers will be free to roam Origin Realms, but that day is not today.

        Q: I’ve always wondered about your miraculous IGN. How did you come up with that ingame-name? Are you a beaver in real life?
        <br><br>
        A: It really all started when I was around 12 years old, I was obsessed with pringles at the time (and I still am) but just "Pringle" was taken, so I stuck on my favorite animal at the end, and there you go, PringleBeaver was born.
        As for being a beaver in real life, I will neither confirm nor deny this.
